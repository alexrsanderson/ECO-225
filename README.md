# ECO-225
In this folder you can find my data science project, "Determining the Relationship between COVID, Demographics, and Economic Factors on the 2020 US Election using County Data" which I did for my ECO225 course at the University of Toronto. I recommend reading the pdf first and if you want to know more about the data scraping and cleaning, read the jupyter notebook.
